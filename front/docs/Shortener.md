URL Shortener Component
Overview
The UrlShortenerForm is a React component that provides a user interface for shortening URLs using a custom hook (useCreateShortUrl). It allows users to input a long URL, submit it to generate a shortened URL, and display the result along with basic statistics. The component is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
Features

URL Input: Users can input a long URL through a form.
Shortening Process: Submits the URL to the useCreateShortUrl hook to generate a shortened URL.
Loading State: Displays a loading state while the URL is being processed.
Result Display: Shows the shortened URL as a clickable link upon successful processing.
Statistics: Displays basic statistics (e.g., original URL) if provided by the API response.
Error Handling: Shows error messages if the URL shortening process fails.
Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.

Dependencies

React: For building the component and managing state.
useCreateShortUrl: A custom hook for handling the URL shortening API logic.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the component.

Installation

Ensure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS configured.
Install required dependencies:npm install react

Ensure the useCreateShortUrl hook is available in your project (this is assumed to be a custom hook handling API calls for URL shortening).

Usage

Import and include the UrlShortenerForm component in your React application:
import UrlShortenerForm from './components/UrlShortenerForm';

function App() {
return (

<div>
<hortener/>
</div>
);
}

Ensure the useCreateShortUrl hook is properly implemented to handle API requests for URL shortening.

Component Structure

State Management:

longUrl: Stores the user-inputted long URL.
shortUrl: Stores the generated shortened URL.
stats: Stores additional statistics returned from the API.
error: Stores any error messages from the API.
loading: Tracks the loading state during API calls.

Event Handlers:

handleSubmit: Handles form submission, calls the createShortUrl function, and updates state based on the response.

UI Elements:

A form with a URL input field and a submit button.
Conditional rendering for loading state, shortened URL, statistics, and error messages.

Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling:

Form container: White background, rounded corners, shadow, and padding.
Input field: Full-width, bordered, with focus states.
Button: Indigo-themed, with hover and disabled states.
Result/Stats/Error: Color-coded sections (green for success, blue for stats, red for errors).

Notes

The component is marked with "use client" to indicate it runs on the client side (Next.js-specific).
The useCreateShortUrl hook is assumed to handle API communication and return an object with shortUrl, shortCode, and originalUrl properties.
Error handling is minimal in the provided code; you may want to enhance it to display specific error messages from the err object.
The component is designed to be reusable and can be integrated into larger applications.

Example
<UrlShortenerForm />

This renders a form where users can input a URL (e.g., https://example.com), click "Shorten," and receive a shortened URL (e.g., https://short.url/abc123) along with any available statistics.
Future Improvements

Add input validation for URLs before submission.
Enhance error handling to display specific error messages.
Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for the shortened URL.
Support additional statistics (e.g., click count, creation date).
